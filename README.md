# OpenSlides Vote Service

The Vote Service is part of the OpenSlides environments. It handles the votes
for an electonic poll.


## Install and Start

The docker build uses the redis messaging service, the auth token and postgres.
Make sure the service inside the docker container can connect to this services.
 The auth-secrets have to given as a file.

```
docker build . --tag openslides-vote
printf "my_token_key" > auth_token_key 
printf "my_cookie_key" > auth_cookie_key
docker run --network host -v $PWD/auth_token_key:/run/secrets/auth_token_key -v $PWD/auth_cookie_key:/run/secrets/auth_cookie_key openslides-vote
```

It uses the host network to connect to redis.


## Example Request with CURL

### Start a Poll

To start a poll a POST request has to be send to the start-url.

To send the same request twice is ok.

```
curl -X POST localhost:9013/internal/vote/start?id=1 
```


### Send a Vote

A vote-request is a post request with the ballot as body. Only logged in users
can vote. The body has to be valid json. For example for the value 'Y' you have
to send `{"value":"Y"}`.

This handler is not idempotent. If the same user sends the same data twice, it
is an error.

```
curl localhost:9013/system/vote?id=1 -d '{"value":"Y"}'
```


### Stop the Poll

With the stop request a poll is stopped and the vote values are returned. The
stop request is a POST request without a body.

A stop request can be send many times and will return the same data again.

```
curl -X POST localhost:9013/internal/vote/stop?id=1
```


### Clear the poll

After a vote was stopped and the data is successfully stored in the datastore, a
clear request should be used to remove the data from the vote service. This is
especially important on fast votes to remove the mapping between the user id and
the vote. The clear requet is idempotent.

```
curl -X POST localhost:9013/internal/vote/clear?id=1 
```


### Clear all polls

Only for development and debugging there is an internal route to clear all polls
at once. It there are many polls, this url could take a long time fully blocking
redis. Use this carfully.

```
curl -X POST localhost:9013/internal/vote/clear_all
```


### Have I Voted

A user can find out if he has voted for a list of polls.

```
curl localhost:9013/system/vote/voted?ids=1,2,3
```

The responce is a json-object in the form like this:

```
{
  "1":[42],
  "2":[42],
  "3":[42]
}
```

`42` is the user ID of the user. If a delegated user has also voted, the user id
of that users will also be in the response.


### Vote Count

The vote count handler tells how many users have voted. It is an open connection
that first returns the data for every poll known by the vote service and then
sends updates when the data changes.

The vote service knows about all started and stopped votes until they are
cleared. When a poll get cleared, the hander sends `0` as an update.

The data is streamed in the json-line-format. That means, that every update is
returned with a newline at the end and does not contain any other newline.

Each line is a map from the poll-id (as string) to the number of votes.


Example:

```
curl localhost:9013/internal/vote/vote_count
```

Response:

```
{"5": 1004,"7": 203}
{"5:0}
{"7":204}
{"9:"1}
```


## Configuration

The service is configurated with environment variables. See [all environment varialbes](environment.md).

If VOTE_SINGLE_INSTANCE it uses the memory to save fast votes. If not, it uses redis.
