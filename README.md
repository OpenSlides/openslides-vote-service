# OpenSlides Vote Service

The Vote Service is part of the OpenSlides environments. It is responsible for
the `poll`, `poll_config_X`, `poll_config_option` and `ballot` collections. It
handles the electronic voting.

The service has no internal state but uses the normal postgres database to save
the polls.


## Handlers

All requests to the vote-service have to be POST-requests.

With the exception of the vote request, all requests can only be sent by a
manager. The permission depends on the field `content_object_id` of the
corresponding poll.

- motions: `motion.can_manage`
- assignments: `assignment.can_manage`
- topic: `poll.can_manage`

With the exception of the create request, all requests need an HTTP GET argument
in the url, to specify the poll-id. For example `/system/vote/update?id=23`


### Create a poll

`/system/vote/create`

The permissions for the create requests are a bit different, since the poll does
not exist in the database, when the request is sent. Therefore the permission
check depends on the field `content_object_id` in the request body.

The request expects a body with the fields to create the poll:

- `title` (required)
- `description` (optional)
- `content_object_id` (required)
- `meeting_id` (required)
- `method` (required)
- `config` (depends on the method)
- `visibility` (required)
- `entitled_group_ids` (only if visibility != manually)
- `live_voting_enabled` (only if visibility != manually)
- `result` (only if visibility == manually)
- `allow_vote_split` (default: false)


### Update a poll

`/system/vote/update?id=XX`

The fields `content_object_id` and `meeting_id` can not be changed. You have to
create a new poll to "update" them.

The fields `method`, `config`, `visibility` and `entitled_group_ids` can only be
changed, before the poll has started. You can reset a poll to change this
values.


### Delete a poll

`/system/vote/delete?id=XX`

The delete request removes the poll and all its ballots in any state. Be careful.


### Start a poll

`/system/vote/start?id=XX`

To start a poll means that the users can send their ballots.


### Finalize a poll

`/system/vote/finalize?id=XX`

To finalize a poll means that users can not send their ballots anymore. It
creates the `poll/result` field.

The request has two optional attributes: `publish` and `anonymize`. `publish`
sets the field `poll/state` to `published`. `anonymize` removes all user ids
from the corresponding `ballot` objects.

The request can be send many times. It only creates the result the first time.
`publish` and `anonymize` can be used on a later request.

To stop a poll and publish and anonymize it at the same time, the following
request can be used:

`/system/vote/finalize?id=42&publish&anonymize`


### Reset a poll

`/system/vote/reset?id=XX`

Reset sets the state back to `created` and removes all `ballot` objects.


### Send a ballot

A vote-request is a post request with the ballot as body. Only logged in users
can vote. The body has to be valid json.

The service distinguishes between two users on each vote-request. The acting
user is the request user, that sends the vote-request. The represented user is
the user, for whom the ballot is sent. Both users can be the same.

The acting user has to be present in the meeting and needs the permission to
vote for the represented user. The represented user has to be in one of the
group of the field `poll/entitled_group_ids`.

The request body has to be in the form:

```json
{
  "meeting_user_id": 23,
  "value": "Yes",
  "split": false
}
```

In this example, the request user would send the Vote `Yes` for the user with
the meeting_user_id 23. If the acting user and the represented user are the
same, then field `meeting_user_id` is not needed. `split` activates
[vote_split](#vote split)

Valid values for the vote depend on the poll method.


### Read the poll

The service only handles write requests. All Reads have to be done via the
autoupdate-service.


## poll/visibility

The field `poll/visibility` can be one of `manually`, `named`, `open` and
`secret`.


### manually

Manually polls are polls without electronic voting. The result is calculated
from individual vote-requests from the users, but the manager sets the result
manually.

Manual polls behave differently. When created, the field `poll/state` is set to
`finished`. The poll result can be set either with the create request or with an
update request. The server does not validate the field `poll/result`, but
accepts any string.

vote-requests are not possible. A finalize-request is possible, but only to set
the `poll/published` field. A reset-request sets/leaves the state at `finished`.


### named and open

At the moment, the visibilities `named` and `open` behave nearly the same. They
have two different meanings. In future versions, there will probably be
different features for this two modes.

The value `named` means that the mapping between votes and users is not deleted
at the end. In a political context, a 'named' poll also means that eligible
voters are called individually, publicly, and one after another, and asked for
their vote. In the future, a feature could be considered where, for
`named`-polls, users cannot vote themselves, but instead the manager is guided
through a form in which they can enter the votes for all eligible voters one
after another. A `named`-poll can not be anonymized.

The value `open` is likely the normal case for a vote. The mapping between votes
and users CAN be deleted afterwards with the `anonymize` flag of the finalize
handler.


### secret

At the moment, a `secret`-poll is identical to an `open`- or `named`-poll. But
is handled differently in the autoupdate-service. The field
`ballot/acting_user_id` and `ballot/represented_user_id` get restricted for
everybody.

In the future, these values will be used for crypto votes. See the entry in the
[wiki](https://github.com/OpenSlides/OpenSlides/wiki/DE%3AKonzept-geheime-Wahlen-mit-OpenSlides)


## Poll methods

The values of `config`in the poll-create-request, `ballot/value` and
`poll/result` depend on the field poll method.

The method of a poll can be calculated by looking at the collection-part of the
generic-relation-field `poll.config_id`.


### approval

On an approval poll, the users can vote with `yes`, `no` or `abstain`. This is
the usual method to vote on a motion.


#### config

`allow_abstain`: if set to `true`, users are allowed to vote with `abstain`. The
default is `true`.


#### ballot/value

Valid ballots look like: `{"value":"yes"}`, `{"value":"no"}` or
`{"value":"abstain"}`.


#### poll/result

The poll result looks like:

`{"yes": "32", "no": "20", "abstain": "10", "invalid": 2}`

Attributes with a zero get discarded.

The values are decimal values decoded as string. See [Vote
Weight](#vote-weight).


### selection

On a selection poll, the users select one or many options from a list of
options. For example one candidate in a assignment-poll.


#### config

`option_type` (required): The type of the options. Can be `text` or
`meeting_user`.

`options` (required): list of options. If option_type is `text`, the list-values
have to be from type string. If `option_type` is `meeting_user`, the values have
to be existing meeting_user_ids.

`max_options_amount`: The maximal amount of options a user can vote on. For
example, with a value of `1`, a user is only allowed to vote for one candidate.
The default is no limit.

`min_options_amount`: The minimum amount of options, a user has to vote on. The
default is no limit.

`allow_nota`: Allow `nota` votes, where the user can disapprove of all options.
The default is `false`.


#### ballot/value

A ballot is a list of option ids. For example: `{"value":[1]}`.

To abstain from a poll, an empty list can be delivered: `{"value":[]}`

If `allow_nota` is set, then a user can vote with
[nota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above): `{"value":"nota"}`. This
means, that they disapprove all options.


#### poll/result

A result can look like this:
`{"1":"40","2":"23","nota":"6","abstain":"7","invalid":3}`

The keys of the json-object are option_ids as string.

This means, that users with a combined vote-weight of 40 have voted for the
option 1, 23 for the option 2, 6 with the string `nota`, 7 with
an empty list and 3 with an invalid vote.


### rating-score

A `rating-score` poll is similar to a `selection` poll, but the users can give
a numeric value to each option. For example give each candidate 3 votes.


#### config

`option_type` (required), `options` (required), `max_options_amount` and
`min_options_amount`: Are the same as from a selection-poll. For example:

```json
{
  "option_type": "meeting_user",
  "options": [23,42,77],
  "max_options_amount": 2,
  "min_options_amount":1
}
```

`max_votes_per_option`: The maximal number for each option. The default is no
limit.

`max_vote_sum`: The maximal number of points, that can be shared between the
options. The default is no limit.

`min_vote_sum`: The minimum number of points, that have to be shared between the
options. The default is no limit.


#### ballot/value

A ballot is an object/dictionary from the `option_id` as string to the numeric
score. For example: `{"value":{"1":3, "2":1}}`.

An empty object means abstain: `{"value":{}}`


#### poll/result

A result can looks simular to a `selection`-result:
`{"1":"40","2":"23",abstain":"7","invalid":3}`


### rating-approval

`rating-approval` is similar to `rating-score`, but for each option, the user
can give a value like `"Yes"`, `"No"` or `"Abstain"`.


#### config

`option_type` (required), `options` (required), `max_options_amount` and
`min_options_amount`: The same as for `selection` or `rating-score`.

`allow_abstain`: The same as for `approval`.


#### ballot/value

A ballot value looks like a combination between `rating-score` and `approval`:
`{"value":{"1":"yes","2":"abstain"}}`.


#### poll/result

A `rating-approval` result looks like:
`{"1":{"yes":"5","no":"1"},"2":{"yes":"1","abstain":"6"},"invalid":1}`

This means, that for the option with id `1`, there where 5 ballots with `Yes`,
one ballot with `No` and no `abstain`. For the option with id `2`, there where
one `Yes`, 6 `Abstain` and no `No`. There where one invalid ballots.

A ballot is invalid, if one of its values is invalid. For example a ballot like
`{"value":{"1":"yes","2":"INVALID-VALUE"}}` is counted as invalid for both
candidates.


## Delegation

A user can delegate his voice to another user. This is only possible in a
meeting, where `meeting/users_enable_vote_delegation` is set to true.

The term `acting_user` means the user, that sends the request. The term
`represented_user` is the user, for whom the acting user sends the vote.

If `meeting/users_forbid_delegator_to_vote` is set to true, then only the user,
where the voice was delegated can vote. If set to `false`, then the
represented_user keeps the permission to vote for himself.


## Vote Weight

Every ballot has a weight. It is a decimal number. The default is `1.000000`.
When `meeting/users_enable_vote_weight` is set to `true`, this value can be
changed for each user. Each user has a default vote weight
(`user/default_vote_weight`), that can be changed for each meeting
(`meeting_user/vote_weight`).

This weight is saved (`ballot/weight`) and taken into account when generating
the result.

The weight is not a floating number, but a decimal number. JSON can not
represent decimal numbers, so they are represented as strings. This is also the
reason, that values in `poll/results` are represented as strings.

This feature does not work on crypto votes, since the server does not know,
which decrypted ballot belongs to which user.


## Vote Split

When `poll/allow_vote_split` is set to true, the users are allowed to split
there vote. They do so, by sending multiple ballots with a weight value, where
the sum of all weights has to be lower or equal then there allowed weight.
Normally 1.

A splitted vote looks like: `{"value":{"0.3":"yes","0.7":"no"},"split":true}`

The attribute `split` says, that vote-split is activated for that ballot, then,
the `value` attribute is an object/dictionary, where the keys are decimals and the
values the normal ballot values.

To be valid, each ballot-part has to be valid. If one part is invalid, the hole
ballot is treated as invalid.

Vote split is not possible for secret polls.


## Invalid Votes

Normally, the service validates the vote requests from the users. So invalid
ballots in the database and therefore in the `poll/result` should not be
possible.

When the field `poll/allow_invalid` is set to true, then the service skips the
validation and saves the ballot exactly, how the user has provided it. In this
case, a user, that wants to create a invalid ballot can use any (invalid) value
for it.

On crypto votes, invalid ballots are allways allowed. The server can not read
the value and has to accept it. Invalid ballots also occur, when the value can
not be decrypted.

When a poll has invalid votes, the amount gets written in the poll result. for
example:

`{"invalid":1,"no":"1","yes":"2"}`

The value is an integer and not a decimal value decoded as string. It counts the
amount of invalid ballots and not the vote-weight.


## Configuration of the service

The service is configured with environment variables. See [all environment
variables](environment.md).
